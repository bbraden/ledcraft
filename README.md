# mcled
A simple minecraft plugin that allows you to control your LED lights with arduino.

# instructions
necessary tools:

[`Arduino`](https://www.amazon.com/Arduino-A000066-ARDUINO-UNO-R3/dp/B008GRTSV6/)

[`IR transmitter`](https://www.amazon.com/Gikfun-Digital-Receiver-Transmitter-Arduino/dp/B0816P2545/)

[`LED lights`](https://www.amazon.com/Livingpai-Changing-Bluetooth-Control-Bedroom/dp/B08M9GYQDM/)

First you will need to plug your arduino into your computer that the minecraft server will be hosted on. Then you can use the Arduino IDE to determine the port that the arduino is on. Copy down that port, for example `COM5`. Then you want to go to the variables file in me.braden.variables and alter the port to whatever the port that you had previously was. Incase you are using the plugin directly without source files, simply enter in your port when the plugin prompts you to on initialization.
